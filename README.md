A guide for building fullstack websites in Go

- [ ] Home page and introduction (Link to the thesis)
- [ ] Quickstart
- [ ] Cookbook? Reference page?
- [ ] Database (Implement this for comments. Once you fully figure out migrations)
- [ ] Hosting guide

I like the ide of a reference page. Add links within the page







Testing:
docker compose up

Prod:
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up (And whatever makes it keep running)
